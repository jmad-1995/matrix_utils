Hi there,
This is my submission for the BrainCorp SE intern assesment.
Please download the submission and then create a build directory in the submission folder
Then use the cmake command to generate the executables in the build directory using the 
following 2 commands in succesion

cmake CMakeLists.txt build 
make

Please check the outputs in the main.exe file generated and play around with the matrices 
in the main.cpp folder to test for the correctness of the program.

Thanks and regards,
